# PWC Power BI Virtual work experience - Customer Churn Retention
Power BI Dashboard for visualization of customer churn 

## Problem Statement :
The purpose of this task is to:
1. Define proper KPI's
2. Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPI's
3. Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed
4. Customers who left within the last month
5. Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
6. Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
7. Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## Insights and Recommendations : 
1. Customers who have opted for the Two-Year contract have demonstrated a longer tenure with the company, whereas the majority of customers on the Month-to-Month contract are relatively new. Based on the analysis, the company is at a potential risk of losing these recently joined customers, particularly if they decide to continue with the Month-to-Month contract.

2. There are 7043 customers who are at risk of churn, representing a churn rate of 27%. The annual charges accrued from these customers amount to $16.06M, with monthly charges totaling $456.12K.

3. In terms of customer service, 2955 technical tickets and 3632 administrative tickets have been opened. A significant portion of the customers who churned had not signed up for Online Security and Tech Support, nor had they opted for Phone Services.

4. A considerable number of customers experienced issues with their Fiber Optic service. In fact, 42% of the customers who churned were using Fiber Optic as their Internet Service.

5. The company could consider encouraging customers to subscribe to the One-Year and Two-Year contracts. However, these contracts may not be perceived as favorable by customers due to higher monthly costs. Offering discounts based on specific tasks could be an effective strategy for retaining customers, especially those on the Month-to-Month contract.

6. The analysis reveals that the majority of customers who churned did not sign up for Online Security and Tech Support. These services are crucial and the company should take steps to educate customers on the benefits of these services.

7. To mitigate the risk of churn, the company could aim to increase the sale of 1 and 2 year contracts by 5% each, and also increase automatic payments by 5% annually.
